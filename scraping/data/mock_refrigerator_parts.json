    "title": "Door Shelf Retainer Bar 240534701",
    "description": "The Door Shelf Retainer Bar, also known as a refrigerator door rack, is a white, plastic part which can be easily installed onto your fridge door. It holds items in your fridge and will show physical damage if broken, at which time it should be replaced. Check your user manual and model number to see if this part is right for you. To install this part, you will need to remove the old one by unlocking the tabs, which can be slid with your fingers. To install the new shelf, line it up with the shelf cut-outs, over the tabs, and gently press it down to lock it into place. This part generally fits the middle door shelf of refrigerators. This is a part that frequently requires multiple parts per refrigerator. Because it is sold individually, you will need to purchase as many door racks as necessary to complete your repair.",
